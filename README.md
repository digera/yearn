It's unsigned, so Windows Defender might yell. I've heard that if you make defender scan it, it will eventually become trusted

currently there are two buttons.

F1 will display all the tooltips (some are broken, wip)

E will spawn a new miner.

All miners must be clicked out of idle atm (working as intended but incomplete)

I've gotten over a thousand miners spawned without many performance issues but please be careful and let me know where you find limits please
